# Getting Started with Create React App


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`



This is a web-based school management system that helps to manage teachers, students, classes, and subjects. The system can also be used for generating essential reports regarding teacher, student, class, and subject details.

Technologies
React
Redux
React Router
React Hooks
MongoDB
Node.js
Express
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Git
Node.js
NPM
MongoDB (locally or Atlas)
Setup
Clone the project repository.
Install the dependencies.
npm install


3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/school_management


4. Run the development server.

npm start

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
The app is divided into the following sections:

Teachers: This section allows you to manage teachers, including their personal details, teaching assignments, and class schedules.
Students: This section allows you to manage students, including their personal details, class assignments, and grades.
Classes: This section allows you to manage classes, including their schedules, teachers, and students.
Subjects: This section allows you to manage subjects, including their descriptions, teachers, and class assignments.
Reports: This section allows you to generate essential reports regarding teacher, student, class, and subject details.
To-Do
Add more features, such as the ability to create and manage exams, assignments, and grades.
Improve the user interface.
Add unit and integration tests.
Credits
This project was created by RUTH AWINO.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
